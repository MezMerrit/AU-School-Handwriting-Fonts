# QLD School Fonts

This specific font includes both:

- Queensland modern cursive (QCursive) - a sloped cursive script for middle primary school

Students in Queensland state schools learn handwriting styles in line with Department of Education standards; QBeginners from years 1 to 3 and QCursive from years 4 to 7. Accordingly, these fonts are designed using the recommended guidelines provided by Department of Education Queensland.
