# QLD School Fonts

This font-set includes both:

- Queensland Beginners Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school
- Queensland Beginners Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage)

Students in Queensland learn QBeginners from years 1 to 3 and QCursive from year 4. 

# Progress Report

Just completed readjusting letter widths and now adding some kerning in order to view the balance and decide what else needs to change.
