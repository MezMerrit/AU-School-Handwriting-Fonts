# QLD School Fonts

This font-set includes both:

- Queensland Beginners Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school
- Queensland Beginners Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage)

Students in Queensland learn QBeginners from years 1 to 3 and QCursive from year 4. 

# Progress Report

Just completed readjusting letter widths and now adding some kerning in order to view the balance and decide what else needs to change.

DB requested UFO file format as he doesn't use Glyphs App, so those files are now present in their respective folders.
