# NSW-ACT-School-Fonts

This font-set includes both:

- New South Wales Foundation Print - a simple sloped print for early primary school
- New South Wales Foundation Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage)

Students in New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory learn Foundation Print from years 1 to 2 and Beginner Cursive from year 3.

# Progress Report

This font-set is nearly ready to hand over to DB for the addition of other characters & the kerning process. Adding transitional glyph alternates now.
