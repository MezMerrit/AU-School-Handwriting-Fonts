# Progress Report

This font-set is ready to hand over to DB for the addition of other characters & the kerning process. It contains no transitional glyph alternates or small caps.

Changes include...

Universal:
========
All glyphs â€œshifted" left
All start points as close to baseline as possible, otherwise left-bottom of stem (ditched the script which claims to optimise them for Master compatibility)
Removed unnecessary control points
Reduced spacing
Lightened all diagonals on bold lowercase glyphs

Individual:
========
Removed 'brace' layers & adjusted uppercase A
Dots below !? and above i j enlarged
Period, Colin, ?, !, moved to baseline with recommended undershoot
Dots on semicolon and colan raised to x-height
% lowered to numeral height
Ampersand raised to Cap height
Slashes adjusted for vertical balance
Point removed from lower case k
Asciitilde named correctly
Space glyph narrowed

Notes:
======
Deliberately minimizing uppercase and lowercase under/overshoots since teachers generally add guides at Cap Height, Descender, Baseline, X-Height and half way between (as per example). Staying within these ruled lines is a strict nationwide standard.
